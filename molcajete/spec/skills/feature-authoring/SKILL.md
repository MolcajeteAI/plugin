# Feature Authoring

Rules for creating and maintaining feature documents: REQUIREMENTS.md, USE-CASES.md, and ARCHITECTURE.md scaffold. The /m:plan command references this skill to run the creation interview and generate all feature artifacts.

## When to Use

- Creating a new feature with /m:feature or /m:spec
- Updating an existing feature's requirements with /m:update-feature
- Understanding the structure and rules for REQUIREMENTS.md, USE-CASES.md, and ARCHITECTURE.md

## Domain Resolution

Before creating or locating a feature, resolve the target domain:

1. Read `prd/DOMAINS.md` to get the list of registered domains
2. If only one domain exists, use it automatically (no user prompt needed)
3. If multiple domains exist, first ask via AskUserQuestion:
   "Is this a cross-cutting concern that applies to every domain in the project?"
   Options: "Yes — create as global feature" / "No — it belongs to a specific domain"
   If yes → use `global` domain, skip step 4.
   If no → proceed to step 4 (which domain?).
4. If multiple domains exist, present them via AskUserQuestion: "Which domain should this feature belong to?\n\n{domain table from DOMAINS.md}" — filter out `global` from the selection (global is only selected via step 3)
5. Use the selected domain for all path operations

All feature paths use the pattern `prd/domains/{domain}/features/FEAT-XXXX-{slug}/`.

### Cross-Cutting Detection Signals

When determining whether a capability is cross-cutting, look for these concrete signals:

| Signal | Evidence |
|--------|----------|
| Multi-domain imports | Code imported/required by 3+ domain directories |
| Infrastructure capability | Auth, logging, notifications, shared UI, error handling, config |
| Identical interface | Same API/interface consumed identically by multiple domains |
| Shared package location | Code lives in `shared/`, `common/`, `lib/`, `packages/shared-*` |
| No domain-specific logic | Capability has no conditional behavior per domain |

When 2+ signals match, include the matching evidence in the cross-cutting AskUserQuestion prompt so the user can make an informed decision.

### Global Feature Artifacts

Global features contain only REQUIREMENTS.md + ARCHITECTURE.md:

- **No USE-CASES.md, no `use-cases/` directory** — use cases belong in domain features, not global
- Global defines baseline requirements (constraints, standards, non-functional requirements) that all domains inherit
- Domains can override global requirements with documented reasoning in their own REQUIREMENTS.md

### Shared Feature ID

Cross-cutting features use the **same FEAT-XXXX ID** across global and all implementing domains:

- One ID is generated; it appears in `prd/domains/global/features/FEAT-XXXX-{slug}/` and in each domain's `prd/domains/{domain}/features/FEAT-XXXX-{slug}/`
- Domain features declare `refs: [FEAT-XXXX]` in REQUIREMENTS.md frontmatter to link back to the global baseline (self-referencing the same ID is expected and correct)
- `refs` can also reference other features the domain feature depends on
- The shared ID makes the relationship explicit — no ambiguity about which domain features map to which global baseline

## Refs Declaration

When creating a domain feature (non-global), after the domain is selected and before the creation interview:

1. Read `prd/FEATURES.md` and extract features from the `## global` section
2. If global features exist, ask via AskUserQuestion:
   "Does this feature depend on any global features?\n\n{global features table}\n\nSelect any that apply, or skip."
   Options: list each global feature + "None — no global dependencies"
3. Record selected refs for inclusion in REQUIREMENTS.md frontmatter and FEATURES.md Refs column

## EARS Syntax

All functional requirements MUST be written in EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax). Each sentence has a mandatory keyword and maps directly to a Gherkin `When/While/If-Then` clause.

| Pattern | Keyword | Template | Use for |
|---------|---------|----------|---------|
| Event-driven | When | `When {trigger}, the system shall {response}.` | User actions, API calls, data events |
| State-driven | While | `While {precondition}, the system shall {response}.` | Conditions that must hold |
| Unwanted behavior | If/Then | `If {trigger}, then the system shall {response}.` | Failure modes, error states |
| Always-on | (none) | `The system shall {response}.` | Invariant behavior |
| Complex | When+While | `While {state}, when {trigger}, the system shall {response}.` | Combined conditions |

**Rules:**
- Never write requirements as prose ("The system should be fast")
- Always use the pattern keyword exactly: "When", "While", "If ... then"
- Each sentence expresses one requirement — no "and" chaining
- Requirements must be falsifiable: a test must be able to pass or fail it

## Fit Criteria

Every functional requirement must include a Fit Criterion immediately after it. The Fit Criterion is the measurable condition that proves the requirement is satisfied.

**Format:**
```
**FR-001** `When {trigger}, the system shall {response}.`
Fit Criterion: Given {precondition}, {measurable outcome that proves this is satisfied}.
Linked to: UC-XXXX
```

**Rules:**
- Fit Criteria use "Given ... {measurable outcome}" format
- The outcome must be verifiable (a test can check it)
- "The system should feel fast" is not a Fit Criterion
- "Given 100 concurrent users, response time is < 200ms at p95" is a Fit Criterion
- Every FR requires one Fit Criterion — no exceptions

## Non-Goals Positioning

The Non-Goals section MUST appear second in REQUIREMENTS.md — immediately after the one-sentence objective, before Actors, before Functional Requirements.

**Why:** LLMs process documents top-to-bottom. Scope boundaries read late are scope boundaries partially ignored. An agent that sees Non-Goals at position 2 will respect them throughout. An agent that sees them at position 8 may already have invented out-of-scope implementations.

**Required order:**
1. Feature name + one-sentence objective (blockquote)
2. ## Non-Goals
3. ## Actors
4. ## UI (optional -- omit if no user interface)
5. ## Functional Requirements
6. ## Non-Functional Requirements
7. ## Acceptance

Non-Goals entries are bullet points starting with "Does not":
```
- Does not handle {X}
- Does not replace {Y}
- Does not support {Z} -- see FEAT-XXXX for that
```

## UI Section

The UI section is optional. It appears at position 4 in REQUIREMENTS.md (after Actors, before Functional Requirements). It provides visual context that informs the reading of requirements that follow. Omit it entirely for features with no user interface.

### Content Types

UI sections support two content types, which can be mixed:

**ASCII art mockups** (default) -- fenced code blocks showing layout:

```
+-------------------+
| Header            |
+-------------------+
| [Search...      ] |
| +------+ +------+ |
| | Card | | Card | |
| +------+ +------+ |
+-------------------+
```

ASCII art conveys layout and element hierarchy. It is always the default -- generate it from the user's description of the feature.

**Image references** -- standard Markdown images pointing to files in `assets/`:

```
![Dashboard overview](assets/overview-dashboard.png)
```

Images are a post-creation enhancement. The `assets/` directory is created inside the feature directory after the feature directory exists. When the user provides image files (file paths), copy them to `prd/domains/{domain}/features/FEAT-XXXX-{slug}/assets/` with descriptive names and reference them in the `## UI` section.

### Asset Management

- Feature-level images go in `prd/domains/{domain}/features/FEAT-XXXX-{slug}/assets/`
- File naming: `{descriptive-slug}.{ext}` -- lowercase, hyphens, no spaces, max 50 character slug
- Supported formats: PNG, JPG
- When the user provides image file paths during creation or update, copy the files and add references

### When to Include

Include the `## UI` section when:
- The feature has screens, forms, or visual interactions
- The user provides mockups, screenshots, or wireframes
- The user describes UI layout in their feature description

Omit the `## UI` section when:
- The feature is pure backend, API-only, or infrastructure
- The user explicitly says no UI

## FEAT-XXXX ID Assignment

When creating a new feature, generate a unique ID using a 4-character timestamp code.

**How to generate the ID:**
Run: `node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/shared/skills/id-generation/scripts/generate-id.js`
Prepend `FEAT-` to the output (e.g., `FEAT-0S9A`).

**IDs are permanent.** Once assigned, a FEAT-XXXX ID is never reused or deleted, even if the feature is deprecated.

## Slug Generation

When creating a feature, generate a kebab-case slug from the confirmed feature name:

1. Lowercase the name
2. Replace spaces and underscores with hyphens
3. Strip all characters except `[a-z0-9-]`
4. Collapse consecutive hyphens
5. Trim leading/trailing hyphens
6. Truncate to max 40 characters at the last full word boundary

**Examples:**
- "User Authentication" → `user-authentication`
- "Real-Time Notifications" → `real-time-notifications`
- "API Rate Limiting & Throttling" → `api-rate-limiting-throttling`

The slug is appended to the FEAT ID with a hyphen: `FEAT-XXXX-{slug}` (e.g., `FEAT-0S9A-user-authentication`).

## FEATURES.md Row Management

When creating a feature, add a new row to `prd/FEATURES.md` under the appropriate section. Add the row under the `## global` section if domain is `global`, otherwise under the `## {domain}` section.

**Cross-cutting features** appear under both `## global` and under each implementing domain's section, using the same FEAT-XXXX ID. The global row has no Refs column; each domain row includes `refs: [FEAT-XXXX]` pointing back to the global baseline.

For domain features:
```
| FEAT-XXXX | {Feature Name} | {One-sentence description} | pending | @FEAT-XXXX | {Refs} | [features/FEAT-XXXX-{slug}/](features/FEAT-XXXX-{slug}/) |
```

For global features (no Refs column):
```
| FEAT-XXXX | {Feature Name} | {One-sentence description} | pending | @FEAT-XXXX | [features/FEAT-XXXX-{slug}/](features/FEAT-XXXX-{slug}/) |
```

**Column rules:**
- **ID:** `FEAT-XXXX` — the generated ID
- **Feature:** Short name (3-5 words)
- **Description:** One sentence — enough for an agent to decide if this is the right feature
- **Status:** Always `pending` when first created
- **Tag:** `@FEAT-XXXX` — used as Gherkin feature tag
- **Refs** (domain features only)**:** Comma-separated FEAT-XXXX IDs of global features this feature depends on (if refs were declared)
- **Directory:** Relative Markdown link to `features/FEAT-XXXX-{slug}/` (relative to the domain's FEATURES.md)

**When updating a feature,** do NOT change the ID or Tag. Update Status only when the feature advances through its lifecycle.

## Creation Interview

**All user interaction MUST use the AskUserQuestion tool.** Never ask questions as plain text. This keeps the agent in control of the flow throughout the interview.

The creation interview extracts structured content from the user's freeform input and presents it section-by-section for review. Files are only written after all sections are confirmed.

### Step 1: Extract from Input

From the user's freeform input, attempt to extract:
- Feature name
- Non-goals (what this feature does NOT do)
- Actors (who uses this feature)
- UI (any mockups, layout descriptions, or image file paths)
- Functional requirements (what the feature does)
- Non-functional requirements (performance, security, reliability)
- Acceptance criteria (how we know it's done)

Convert all extracted FRs to EARS syntax and add Fit Criteria before presenting.

### Step 2: Review Section by Section

For each section, use AskUserQuestion to present what was extracted and ask for confirmation:

**If the input covered the section:**
"For {section name}, this is what I extracted:\n\n{content}\n\nDoes this look correct?"
- Options: "Yes, looks good" / "Edit" (user provides corrections via Other)

**If the input did NOT cover the section:**
"I didn't find any {section name} in your description. Do you have any?"
- Options: "Yes, I'll add them" (user provides via Other) / "No, skip this section"

Present sections in this order:
1. Feature name
2. Non-goals
3. Actors
4. UI (optional -- see UI Section rules above)
5. Functional requirements (shown in EARS syntax with Fit Criteria)
6. Non-functional requirements
7. Acceptance criteria

For the UI step specifically:

**If UI content was extracted from input** (layout descriptions, mockups, image references):
"UI for this feature:\n\n{extracted content}\n\nDoes this look correct?"
- Options: "Yes, looks good" / "Edit" (user provides corrections via Other)

**If UI content was NOT found in input:**
"Does this feature have a user interface? You can describe it and I'll generate ASCII art mockups, or you can provide image file paths."
- Options: "I'll describe the UI" (user provides via Other) / "No UI -- skip"

If the user says "No UI -- skip", do not include the `## UI` section in REQUIREMENTS.md.

If the user describes the UI, generate ASCII art mockups from their description showing layout, key elements, and hierarchy. Use fenced code blocks.

### Step 3: Write Files

After all sections are confirmed:
1. Generate FEAT-XXXX ID (4-character timestamp code)
2. Create `prd/domains/{domain}/features/FEAT-XXXX-{slug}/` directory. **If domain is NOT `global`**, also create `prd/domains/{domain}/features/FEAT-XXXX-{slug}/use-cases/`
3. If the user provided image file paths, create `prd/domains/{domain}/features/FEAT-XXXX-{slug}/assets/` and copy image files with descriptive names
4. Write `prd/domains/{domain}/features/FEAT-XXXX-{slug}/REQUIREMENTS.md` using [REQUIREMENTS-template.md](./templates/REQUIREMENTS-template.md) -- include `## UI` section with confirmed ASCII art and/or image references if UI content was provided; omit `## UI` section entirely if user said no UI. Add `domain: {domain}` to the frontmatter.
5. **If domain is NOT `global`:** Write `USE-CASES.md` using [USE-CASES-template.md](./templates/USE-CASES-template.md) (empty table). **Skip for global** — global features have no use cases.
6. Write `ARCHITECTURE.md` scaffold using the template at `spec/skills/architecture/templates/ARCHITECTURE-template.md`
7. Add row to `prd/FEATURES.md` under the appropriate section (format from the Row Management section above)

## Update Mode

/m:plan uses this skill in update mode:
- Read the current `REQUIREMENTS.md` and `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Compare with the user's change description
- Propose specific changes via AskUserQuestion ("Here's what I'd change: ... Does this look correct?")
- Apply after confirmation
- Do NOT run the creation interview
- Do NOT change the feature's lifecycle status

## ARCHITECTURE.md

For ARCHITECTURE.md schema, sections, and population rules, see the architecture skill (`spec/skills/architecture/SKILL.md`).

During feature creation, scaffold ARCHITECTURE.md using the template at `spec/skills/architecture/templates/ARCHITECTURE-template.md`.

## Template Reference

| Template | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| [REQUIREMENTS-template.md](./templates/REQUIREMENTS-template.md) | REQUIREMENTS.md for each feature |
| [USE-CASES-template.md](./templates/USE-CASES-template.md) | USE-CASES.md index for each feature |
