# Update Scenario

You are updating an existing scenario within a use case based on a change description. You will locate the scenario, propose specific changes, apply after confirmation, bump the UC version, and propagate changes to any existing Gherkin files.

**Input:** $ARGUMENTS

**All user interaction MUST use the AskUserQuestion tool.** Never ask questions as plain text in your response.

## Step 1: Load Skills

Read both skills that govern this command:

1. Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/spec/skills/usecase-authoring/SKILL.md` -- flat scenario structure, Side Effects conventions, update mode rules
2. Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/shared/skills/gherkin/SKILL.md` -- generation rules, tagging, step writing

## Step 2: Parse Arguments

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` into two parts:

1. **Scenario ID** -- the first token, expected format `SC-XXXX`
2. **Change description** -- everything after the scenario ID

If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty or does not start with an `SC-` token, tell the user:

"Usage: `/m:update-scenario SC-XXXX <change description>`. Provide a valid scenario ID and describe what to change."

Then stop.

If the change description is empty (only an SC ID was provided), use AskUserQuestion:
- Question: "What changes do you want to make to {SC-XXXX}? Describe what should be added, removed, or modified in the scenario."
- Header: "Change Description"

## Step 3: Locate Scenario

1. Grep `prd/domains/*/features/*/use-cases/*.md` for the heading pattern `### SC-XXXX:` (substituting the actual ID). If not found, tell the user:

   "Scenario {SC-XXXX} not found in any use case file. Check the ID and try again."

   Then stop.

2. Extract the UC file path from the grep result.

3. Extract the parent `UC-XXXX` from the filename (e.g., `UC-0S9A.md` -> `UC-0S9A`).

4. Extract the parent `FEAT-XXXX` from the directory path (under `features/`) and the domain from the path (under `prd/domains/`).

5. Verify `prd/FEATURES.md` exists and FEAT-XXXX is listed. If either check fails, tell the user and stop.

## Step 4: Load Context

Read these files to understand the current state:

- `prd/PROJECT.md` -- project description
- `prd/TECH-STACK.md` -- technology choices (if exists)
- `prd/ACTORS.md` -- known actors (if exists)
- `prd/domains/{domain}/features/FEAT-XXXX-{slug}/REQUIREMENTS.md` -- feature requirements
- `prd/domains/{domain}/features/FEAT-XXXX-{slug}/ARCHITECTURE.md` -- architecture context (if exists)
- `prd/domains/{domain}/features/FEAT-XXXX-{slug}/use-cases/UC-XXXX-{slug}.md` -- the use case containing this scenario

## Step 5: Analyze and Propose Changes

Read the full UC file and locate the `### SC-XXXX:` block. Extract the current scenario content:
- Given
- Steps
- Outcomes
- Side Effects

Compare the change description against the current scenario content.

Use AskUserQuestion to present the proposed changes:
- Question: "Here's what I'd change in **SC-XXXX** (within {UC-XXXX}):\n\n{describe each change -- what's added, modified, or removed in the scenario, showing before/after for modifications}\n\nDoes this look correct?"
- Header: "Proposed Changes"
- Options: "Yes, apply these changes" / "Edit" (user corrects via Other)

If the user wants edits, revise the proposal and present again via AskUserQuestion.

## Step 6: Apply Spec Changes

Apply the confirmed changes to the scenario within the UC file:

1. Edit `prd/domains/{domain}/features/FEAT-XXXX-{slug}/use-cases/UC-XXXX-{slug}.md` -- modify only the `### SC-XXXX:` block with confirmed changes.

2. Set the scenario heading annotation to `dirty`:
   ```
   ### SC-XXXX: {Scenario Name} `dirty`
   ```

3. Increment the `version` field in the UC file's YAML frontmatter.

4. Set `status` to `dirty` in the UC file's YAML frontmatter.

5. Update the status column in `prd/domains/{domain}/features/FEAT-XXXX-{slug}/USE-CASES.md` to `dirty` for this UC row.

6. Do NOT change the SC-XXXX ID, UC-XXXX ID, or any tags.

## Step 7: Gherkin Propagation

Grep `bdd/features/` for `@SC-XXXX`. If no `.feature` file contains this tag, skip to Step 8.

If a `.feature` file exists with `@SC-XXXX`:

### 7.1 Determine Gherkin Changes

Based on the spec changes applied in Step 6, determine what Gherkin changes are needed for the matching scenario block:

- **Given changed** -- update `Given`/`And` clauses
- **Steps changed** -- update `When`/`And` clauses
- **Outcomes changed** -- update `Then`/`And` clauses
- **Side Effects changed** -- update trailing `And`/`And no` clauses
### 7.2 Preview Gherkin Changes

Use AskUserQuestion to preview the Gherkin changes:
- Question: "The following Gherkin changes are needed to match the updated scenario:\n\n**{feature-file-path}:**\n\n```gherkin\n# Before:\n{current scenario block}\n\n# After:\n{updated scenario block}\n```\n\nDoes this look correct?"
- Header: "Gherkin Changes"
- Options: "Yes, apply these changes" / "Edit" (user corrects via Other)

If the user wants edits, revise and present again.

### 7.3 Apply Gherkin Changes

1. Edit the `.feature` file -- update only the `@SC-XXXX` scenario block with the confirmed changes.
2. Add `@dirty` to the scenario's tag line if not already present. If `@pending` is present, remove it (the scenario was previously implemented, `@dirty` replaces it as the lifecycle state).

## Step 8: Report

Tell the user what changed:

- Summarize the scenario changes applied to the UC file
- Note the UC version bump (e.g., "version: 1 -> 2") and status change to `dirty`
- If Gherkin was updated, list the Gherkin files modified and summarize changes
- If Gherkin was NOT updated (no existing feature file), note: "No existing Gherkin for this scenario. Run `/m:scenario UC-XXXX` to generate Gherkin when ready."
