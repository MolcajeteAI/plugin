# Git Committing

Standards for how agents create git commits during task execution. This skill defines message format, style detection, atomicity rules, and scope assessment. It does not define a user-facing command — it is reference material for agents that commit as part of their work.

## When to Use

- An agent has completed a task and needs to commit the changes
- An agent needs to decide whether to commit now or continue accumulating changes
- An agent needs to split a large set of changes into multiple commits

## Style Detection

Before writing any commit message, detect the project's existing style:

1. Run `git log --oneline -20` and examine the output
2. **Prefixes**: Default to conventional prefixes (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, etc.). Only drop them and use verb-only format if the majority of recent commits do NOT use prefixes.
3. **Verb tense**: Match the existing pattern. Most projects use either "Adds" (third person) or "Add" (imperative). Follow what's already there.
4. **Casing**: Match subject line casing — some projects capitalize after the prefix, some don't.

The detected style applies to all commits in the session. Do not mix styles.

## Message Format

### Structure

```
<prefix>: <what changed>

- <what was done detail 1>
- <what was done detail 2>

<FEAT-XXXX>
- <UC-XXXX>: <use case name>
  - <SC-XXXX>: <scenario name>
  - <SC-XXXX>: <scenario name>
```

The first line is the subject. The body (bullet points) is optional but recommended for non-trivial changes. The spec references block is mandatory when the commit has PRD context (see Spec References below). Separate each section with a blank line.

### Subject Line Rules

1. **Start with a verb** — capitalize the first letter (or follow prefix convention):
   - **Adds** — new files, features, or functionality
   - **Fixes** — bug fixes or corrections
   - **Updates** — changes to existing features
   - **Removes** — deletion of features, files, or code
   - **Refactors** — code restructuring without behavior change
   - **Improves** — performance or quality enhancements
   - **Moves** — file or code relocation
   - **Renames** — renaming files, variables, or functions
   - **Replaces** — swapping one implementation for another
   - **Simplifies** — reducing complexity

2. **Maximum 50 characters** — if it exceeds 50, move details to the body.

3. **Describe what changed**, not what was wrong:
   - Good: "Fixes login redirect after authentication"
   - Bad: "Fixes bug where users were stuck on login page"

4. **Use simple language** — avoid jargon when plain words work:
   - Good: "Adds user search feature"
   - Bad: "Implements user discovery mechanism"

### Conventional Commit Prefixes

Use conventional prefixes by default (see Style Detection). Only drop them if the project's history shows the majority of commits without prefixes.

| Prefix | Use When |
|--------|----------|
| `feat:` | New features or functionality |
| `fix:` | Bug fixes |
| `test:` | Adding or updating tests |
| `chore:` | Maintenance, dependencies, config |
| `docs:` | Documentation changes |
| `refactor:` | Code restructuring without behavior change |
| `perf:` | Performance improvements |

### Body Rules

Use bullet points (hyphens, not paragraphs) to explain **why** when:
- The change affects multiple files or areas
- The reasoning is not obvious from the diff
- Multiple steps or trade-offs were involved

For simple, obvious changes, a single subject line is enough.

### Issue References

Place issue references at the end of the subject line in parentheses:

```
Fixes payment processing error (#123)
```

Do not use issue tracker language as the subject — "Resolves #123" says nothing about what changed.

## Spec References

When a commit is part of a task that has PRD context (feature, use cases, scenarios), include a spec references block at the end of the commit body.

### Format

```
FEAT-XXXX
- UC-XXXX: Use case name
  - SC-XXXX: Scenario name
  - SC-XXXX: Scenario name
- UC-XXXX: Use case name
  - SC-XXXX: Scenario name
```

### Rules

1. Place the refs block **after** the description body, separated by a blank line
2. Feature ID alone on its own line (no label prefix like "Feature:" — just the ID)
3. Use cases as top-level bullets with their name
4. Scenarios indented under their parent use case with their name
5. Only include use cases and scenarios relevant to this commit, not the entire feature
6. **Mandatory** when the commit is part of a task with feature/UC/scenario context
7. **Omit** for commits with no PRD context (dependency updates, config changes, tooling)

## No AI Attribution

**Mandatory — no exceptions.**

- Never add "Generated with Claude Code" or similar
- Never add "Co-Authored-By: Claude" or any AI co-author line
- Never add AI emoji, "AI-assisted", or tool mentions

Commits must look like normal human development. Focus on what changed, not how it was produced.

## Atomic Commits

Each commit represents one logical change:
- One bug fix per commit
- One feature per commit
- One refactoring per commit

Do not mix unrelated changes:
- Bad: fixing a bug AND adding a feature in one commit
- Bad: updating dependencies AND refactoring code in one commit

Small, frequent commits are better than large, infrequent ones: easier to review, easier to revert, better git history.

## Scope Assessment

After completing work, assess whether the changes should be one commit or multiple.

### Single Commit

Changes are **one logical concern** when they all serve the same intent:
- Multiple files touched by one feature = one commit
- A version bump + changelog + the feature it describes = one commit
- A new command + its skill + plugin registration = one commit

Judge by intent, not by file count.

### Multiple Commits Needed

Changes contain **multiple independent concerns** when:
- A new feature AND an unrelated bug fix
- A refactor AND a dependency update
- Changes to module A's API AND an unrelated config change to module B

### Splitting Strategy

When changes need splitting:

1. Identify the independent concerns and their affected files
2. Group files by concern — each group becomes one commit
3. Order commits by dependency: infrastructure first, then features, then fixes
4. Stage and commit each group separately with its own message

## Pre-Commit Checklist

Before committing, verify the diff:
- No debug code (`console.log`, print statements, debugger)
- No commented-out code
- No temporary test data or hardcoded values
- No unintended file changes
- No secrets (API keys, passwords, tokens, `.env` files)
- Stage specific files, not `git add .`
