## Execution Strategy

### Recommended Approach

{Description of how to implement these tasks — which to start with, what can be parallelized.}

### Critical Path

```mermaid
graph LR
    A["UC-{tag}-001 / 1.1"] --> B["UC-{tag}-001 / 1.2"]
    B --> C["UC-{tag}-001 / 2"]
    A --> D["UC-{tag}-002 / 1"]
    D --> E["UC-{tag}-002 / 1.1"]
```

### Parallel Opportunities

- {Tasks X.Y and Z.W can be developed in parallel because they have no shared dependencies}

---

**Notes:**

- Tasks are organized as vertical slices through all layers (database, API, UI)
- Each feature section maps to a use case from requirements.md
- Infrastructure work belongs to the UC that needs it — include it as subtasks within that UC's scope
- Complexity uses story points (1/2/3/5/8) — not time estimates
- When a task is completed, mark its checkbox and add:
  - `Completed: {YYYY-MM-DD}`
  - `Notes: {brief implementation notes, decisions, files created/modified}`
