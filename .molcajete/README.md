## Purpose

All plugin outputs are stored in `.molcajete/` to:

1. **Easy Exclusion**: Add `.molcajete/` to your project's `.gitignore` if you don't want to commit plugin outputs
2. **Organization**: Keep all Molcajete-generated files separate from your project code
3. **Portability**: The directory is created in the context where Claude Code is called from

## What's Gitignored

The `.molcajete/.gitignore` file automatically ignores:
- `tmp/` - Temporary research session files and intermediate data

## What to Commit

You may want to commit:
- `prd/` - Product planning documents if using version-controlled specs
- `research/` - Saved research documents if valuable to your team

Add this to your project's `.gitignore` to exclude all Molcajete outputs:
```
.molcajete/
```

Or selectively exclude only temporary files (commit prd/ and research/):
```
.molcajete/tmp/
```
