## Execution Strategy

**Recommended Approach:** Sequential | Parallel
**Rationale:** [Why this approach makes sense for this spec]

### Sequential Execution Plan
1. Complete Feature 1 (all tasks in order)
2. Verify Feature 1 works end-to-end
3. Complete Feature 2 (all tasks in order)
4. Verify Feature 2 works end-to-end
5. Complete Feature 3 (all tasks in order)
6. Final verification and testing

### Parallel Execution Plan (if applicable)
- **Subagent 1:** Features 1 & 2 (independent features)
- **Subagent 2:** Feature 3 (after Feature 1 completes)

**Note:** Parallel execution only recommended when features are truly independent.
