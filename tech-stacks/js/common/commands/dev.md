# Run Development Environment

Start the development server or watcher.

Execute the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This typically runs:
- `tsx watch src/index.ts` for libraries/CLIs
- A framework-specific dev server for apps

**Notes:**
- Development mode enables hot reloading
- TypeScript errors are shown in real-time
- Press Ctrl+C to stop the server
