# Run Test Suite

Execute all tests using Vitest.

Execute the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

This runs:
```bash
vitest run
```

**Expected Output:**
- Test results with pass/fail counts
- Any failing test details

**Quality Requirements:**
- All tests must pass
- No skipped tests in CI

Reference the **testing-patterns** and **vitest-configuration** skills.
