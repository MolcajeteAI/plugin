# Optimize Performance

Analyze and suggest performance optimizations.

Use the Task tool to launch the **optimizer** agent with instructions:

1. Profile the application (CPU and memory)
2. Identify hot paths and bottlenecks
3. Suggest optimizations based on profiling data
4. Create benchmark baseline
5. Optionally apply optimizations (with user approval)
6. Re-run benchmarks
7. Compare before/after using benchstat
8. Document performance improvements

**Optimization Approach:**
1. Profile first (never guess)
2. Focus on actual bottlenecks
3. Benchmark before and after
4. Maintain readability
5. Document why optimizations were made

Reference the performance-profiling and optimization-techniques skills.
