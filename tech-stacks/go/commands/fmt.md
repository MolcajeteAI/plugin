# Format Code

Format all Go code using go fmt.

Use the Task tool to launch the **developer** agent with instructions:

1. Run `make fmt` (or `go fmt ./...`)
2. Show which files were formatted
3. Verify all code is now properly formatted
4. Display success message

**Note:** This should be run after EVERY code change.

Reference the code-quality skill.
