# Run Application

Run the application using the Makefile.

Use the Task tool to launch the **developer** agent with instructions:

1. Verify Makefile exists
2. Run `make run` to build and run application
3. Show application output
4. If errors occur, display and suggest fixes

**Requirements:**
- Use `make run`, which typically depends on `make build`
- Application runs from `./bin/` directory

Reference the project-structure skill.
