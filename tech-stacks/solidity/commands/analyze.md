# Run Static Analysis

Run static analysis on contracts using Slither.

Use the Task tool to launch the **auditor** agent with the following instructions:

1. Check if Slither is installed
2. Run static analysis: `slither .`
3. Parse and categorize findings by severity:
   - High severity
   - Medium severity
   - Low severity
   - Informational
4. Filter out known false positives if configured
5. Report findings with file and line references
6. Provide brief explanation of each issue
7. Suggest fixes for high-severity issues

Reference the security-audit skill.
